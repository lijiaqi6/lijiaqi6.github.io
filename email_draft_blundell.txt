Subject: Permission to list UCL visit on CV - Jiaqi Li

Dear Professor Blundell,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing regarding my research visit to UCL from January to March 2023 which I was unfortunately unable to meet with you directly.

As I am currently preparing my CV for the economics job market, I wanted to respectfully ask if you would be comfortable with me listing this visit on my CV as:

"Visits: University College London (January-March 2023, Host: Professor Sir Richard Blundell), University of Mannheim (November 2024, Host: Professor Mich√®le Tertilt)"

I completely understand if you would prefer not to be listed as host given that we were unable to meet in person, and I would be happy to either omit the visit.

With kind regards,

Jiaqi Li
