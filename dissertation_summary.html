    <h1>Dissertation Summary</h1>
    <div class="author">Jiaqi Li<br>Department of Economics, University of Warwick</div>
    
    <p>My dissertation contains three papers on household time allocation, investigating how the decisions of mothers, fathers, and children shape inequality. By combining rich micro data with quantitative macro models and causal inference, I provide new evidence on how inequality arises from household choices, and identify mechanisms through which policy can reduce these disparities.</p>

                <h3>Chapter 1: Mothers (Job Market Paper) <a href="li_race.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #1b4332; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em;">[PDF]</a></h3>
        <p>My job market paper speaks to the puzzle of why Black women in the U.S. exhibit higher labour-market attachment than White women with similar observables. High-wage Black women return to work sooner after childbirth, incurring a smaller "child penalty". I show that this is driven by heightened risks in the labour and marriage markets. Using a structural life-cycle model estimated on PSID data, I show that high-ability Black women rely on labour market attachment as self-insurance, sacrificing leisure while preserving parenting time. This generates smaller observed penalties in wages and employment but larger unobserved penalties via lost leisure. Counterfactuals reveal that equalising divorce and layoff risks can close up to 75% of the racial gap in child penalties. I complement the quantitative macro model with quasi-experimental evidence. Exploiting the staggered introduction of unilateral divorce reforms across U.S. states, which differed in asset-division rules, I use a triple-difference strategy to show that Black women giving birth after these reforms experienced markedly smaller child penalties in employment, particularly in title-based states where women faced the greatest financial risk. A falsification test on single women, not exposed to marital dissolution risks, finds no effect—reinforcing that the results reflect marital institutions rather than broader economic trends.</p>

        <h3>Chapter 2: Fathers <a href="Father.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #1b4332; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em;">[PDF]</a></h3>
        <p>Chapter 2 turns to fathers. This paper shows that heterogeneity in fathers' parenting time is a critical but overlooked driver of inequality in children's human capital. Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I estimate a dynamic factor model of child development with a control function approach, instrumenting paternal time with shift-share local labour demand shocks by gender. I find that equalising fathers' time across childhood stages would substantially reduce disparities—by 22% in cognition and 49% in health outcomes by adolescence.</p>

        <h3>Chapter 3: Children <a href="Drought.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: #1b4332; text-decoration: none; font-size: 0.9em;">[PDF]</a></h3>
        <p>Chapter 3 turns to children. This paper shows that road infrastructure critically shapes how rainfall shocks affect education in Ethiopia. While existing research emphasises child labour as the main channel by which rainfall shocks impact education, I highlight commuting as an additional mechanism. Using panel data from 2002–2016, I document non-linear effects: excessive rainfall increases commuting time and reduces enrolment, but only in villages where school access depends on dirt rather than gravel roads. The cognition gap between villages with different road quality widens when rainfall deviates from normal, driven by shocks during school terms. Event-study evidence and a cognition production function with time inputs show that commuting affects both the quantity and the quality of study hours, with long commutes lowering effective learning.</p>
