    <h1>Research Statement</h1>
    <div class="author">Jiaqi Li<br>Department of Economics, University of Warwick</div>
    
    <div class="research-summary">
        <p><strong>Research Overview:</strong> My research lies at the intersection of <span class="highlight">structural labour economics, development economics, and applied microeconomics</span>. I investigate how household time allocation decisions of mothers, fathers, and children shape inequality, combining rich micro data with quantitative macro models and causal inference to provide new evidence on how inequality arises from household choices and identify mechanisms through which policy can reduce these disparities.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Research Agenda</h2>
    
    <p>My dissertation, <em>"Three Essays on Household Time Allocation,"</em> examines how time allocation decisions within households contribute to broader economic inequalities. Each chapter focuses on a different family member—mothers, fathers, and children—using innovative methodological approaches that combine structural modeling with causal identification strategies.</p>
    
    <h2>Dissertation Chapters</h2>
    
    <div class="chapter">
        <h3>Chapter 1: The Shadow Child Penalty and Racial Inequality in Labour‑ and Marriage‑Market Risk (Job Market Paper)</h3>
        
        <p>This paper addresses the puzzle of why Black women in the U.S. exhibit higher labour-market attachment than White women with similar observable characteristics. High-wage Black women return to work sooner after childbirth, incurring a smaller "child penalty."</p>
        
        <div class="methodology">
            <strong>Methodology:</strong> I develop a structural life-cycle model estimated on Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data, combined with quasi-experimental evidence exploiting the staggered introduction of unilateral divorce reforms across U.S. states with different asset-division rules using a triple-difference strategy.
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> High-ability Black women rely on labour market attachment as self-insurance, driven by heightened risks in labour and marriage markets. This generates smaller observed penalties in wages and employment but larger unobserved penalties via lost leisure. Counterfactuals reveal that equalising divorce and layoff risks can close up to 75% of the racial gap in child penalties.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Policy Implications:</strong> The results highlight how institutional factors—particularly marital dissolution laws—can perpetuate racial inequalities in career trajectories, suggesting targeted policy interventions in legal frameworks governing marriage and employment protection.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="chapter">
        <h3>Chapter 2: Fathers, Time Investment and Human Capital Inequality</h3>
        
        <p>This paper demonstrates that heterogeneity in fathers' parenting time is a critical but overlooked driver of inequality in children's human capital development.</p>
        
        <div class="methodology">
            <strong>Methodology:</strong> Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics data, I estimate a dynamic factor model of child development with a control function approach, instrumenting paternal time with shift-share local labour demand shocks by gender.
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> Equalising fathers' time investment across childhood stages would substantially reduce disparities—by 22% in cognition and 49% in health outcomes by adolescence. This challenges the literature's focus on maternal time allocation and highlights fathers as key drivers of human capital inequality.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="chapter">
        <h3>Chapter 3: On the Way to School: Drought, Enrolment and Commuting Time</h3>
        
        <p>This paper examines how road infrastructure shapes the relationship between rainfall shocks and education in Ethiopia, highlighting commuting as an additional mechanism beyond the traditionally studied child labour channel.</p>
        
        <div class="methodology">
            <strong>Methodology:</strong> Using panel data from 2002–2016, I employ event-study designs and estimate a cognition production function with time inputs, exploiting variation in road quality and rainfall patterns.
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>Key Findings:</strong> I document non-linear effects where excessive rainfall increases commuting time and reduces enrolment, but only in villages where school access depends on dirt rather than gravel roads. The cognition gap between villages with different road quality widens when rainfall deviates from normal, particularly during school terms.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Development Policy Relevance:</strong> Results show that infrastructure investments can mitigate education disruptions from climate shocks, with commuting affecting both the quantity and quality of study hours.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Methodological Contributions</h2>
    
    <p>My research contributes methodologically by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Integrating structural and reduced-form approaches:</strong> Combining life-cycle models with quasi-experimental identification strategies</li>
        <li><strong>Novel instrumentation strategies:</strong> Using shift-share labour demand shocks and institutional variations for causal identification</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic factor modeling:</strong> Incorporating time-varying unobserved heterogeneity in child development models</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-country perspectives:</strong> Working with both developed (U.S.) and developing country (Ethiopia) contexts</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Future Research Directions</h2>
    
    <p>Building on my dissertation, my future research agenda focuses on:</p>
    
    <h3>1. Structural Estimation with High-Quality Data</h3>
    <p>I am developing projects that leverage new panel datasets for African countries, currently under review with CEPR's STEG grants programme. This work will extend structural labour economics methods to developing country contexts.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Gender and Development Economics</h3>
    <p>Continuing my focus on gender dynamics in developing countries, examining how structural transformation affects female bargaining power and household decision-making.</p>
    
    <h3>3. Climate and Human Capital</h3>
    <p>Expanding my work on environmental shocks to examine broader climate adaptation strategies and their implications for human capital accumulation.</p>
    
    <h2>Research Impact and Funding</h2>
    
    <p>My research has been supported by competitive external funding:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>STEG PhD Research Grant</strong> (£14,640, Principal Investigator, CEPR 2022)</li>
        <li><strong>LSE Research and Impact Fund</strong> (£11,778, Co-Investigator, 2022)</li>
        <li><strong>Discretionary Research Fund</strong> (£7,596, University of Warwick, 2022-2023)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I am committed to pursuing external funding from ESRC, UKRI, STEG, IZA, and related sources to support this research agenda.</p>
    
    <h2>Teaching and Service Integration</h2>
    
    <p>My research directly informs my teaching in applied microeconomics, structural labour economics, and development economics. I view teaching and research as mutually reinforcing, with classroom discussions often sparking new research questions and methodological insights.</p>
